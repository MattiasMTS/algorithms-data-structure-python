# Arrays

Python does not have a built in `array` type, instead it focuses on using
`lists` as the equivalent data type.

## Advantages of `lists` in Python:
* Simple to create and use.
* Scales w.r.t. input and requirements.
* Can be used to create other more complex data structures.

## Disadvantages of `lists` in Python:
* Not optimized, compared to numpy's `ndarray`
